## What are Coding Patterns?

Coding patterns are templates or blueprints for solving common programming problems. They are based on proven best practices and are designed to be reusable across multiple projects. By using coding patterns, developers can save time and effort by not having to reinvent the wheel each time they encounter a problem. Instead, they can leverage existing patterns to solve problems quickly and efficiently.
